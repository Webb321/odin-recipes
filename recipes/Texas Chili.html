    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>If you are worried about me sharing my dad&rsquo;s secrets, don&rsquo;t be. When I asked him if I could share the
        recipe, his response text included not one, but three, exclamation points. If your dad is anything like mine,
        you know it's a big deal to receive a text that doesn&rsquot end with a period or consists of only a thumbs-up
        emoji.
        I&rsquo;ll take it that he&rsquo;s excited to add this article to the lengthy list of reasons he can be
        considered a Texas chili expert. </p>
